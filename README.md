# Elixir Introduction Workshop

A short workshop to introduce yourself into [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) programming language.

The workshop has three sessions:

- **Session I**: an introduction to [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), where we'll see a bit of history, its main features and advantages over other programming languages, as well as a series of initial concepts such as basic types and operators, pattern matching, control structures, lists and maps, etc.

- **Session II**: a bunch of different problems that we'll solve together thanks to the resources seen in the previous session.

- **Session III**: last session in which we'll develop as a final practical exercise a small **Twitter bot**.

## Environment Setup

This is a practical workshop, so **you'll need to come with your laptop**. In order to be ready to solve the exercises and the final **Twitter** bot, you need to setup your environment with:

- **Some code editor**: like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)...
- **Erlang**: it's the only prerequisite for [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), so you have to install [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org) in your computer. You can follow the installation instructions [here](http://www.erlang.org/downloads).
- **Elixir**: well, seems pretty obvious that we need to have [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) installed, right? You can follow the installation instructions [here](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).

If you have **Linux** or **macOS**, you can install [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org) and [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) through [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) as well, an extendable version manager with support for a bunch of languages.
